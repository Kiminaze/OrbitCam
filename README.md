# OrbitCam

The OrbitCam is a script that allows you to have a separate camera that can orbit a given point or 
entity. This is very useful for certain occasions where the default camera is useless or where you 
need some more control over the camera angle.

When the player is dead, you can no longer move the camera in the base game. This allows you to 
change that.
You could also start a camera when a player is sitting on some benches where the default camera 
would usually glitch into the player.
